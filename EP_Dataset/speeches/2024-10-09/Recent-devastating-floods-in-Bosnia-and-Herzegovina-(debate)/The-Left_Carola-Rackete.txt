Mr President, on behalf of my delegation and The Left Group, I extend my condolences and solidarity to the communities affected by the catastrophic floods across Bosnia and Herzegovina. Over 20 people have died in Bosnia already, with many still missing. The floods caused by Storm Boris a few weeks ago across central Europe killed many more. The storm in the US, called Helene, killed even more, and 11 000 people died in Libya last year. At the same time, the EU was spending EUR 123 billion on fossil fuel subsidies. So these are not natural phenomena. We shouldn't just mourn these irreplaceable lives as if there was nothing that could have been done to prevent it. The fossil fuel-powered deadly storms shouldn't be called Boris or Helene. They should be called Storm TotalEnergies or Storm RWE or Killer Flood Eni. The people who were killed and were lost in the communities, they have been lost to a crime that is committed by the fossil corporations for the interests of profits over people's lives, and the EU and our regulations here, we are complicit in that and we are driving that climate breakdown. I don't know how people in Bosnia could accept our sincere apologies, knowing that every day we are driving the breakdown of the climate system. Because we're not doing enough. We are still driving disaster capitalism just for the interests of fossil corporations. This really has to stop. We can never normalise the loss and the deaths of people.
