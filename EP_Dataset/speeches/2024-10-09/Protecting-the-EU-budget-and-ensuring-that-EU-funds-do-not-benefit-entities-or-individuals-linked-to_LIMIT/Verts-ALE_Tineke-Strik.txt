Madam President, Commissioner, upholding international law obliges us to protect and facilitate the UN bodies. And that is why I stand here with a feeling of embarrassment   embarrassment that through this debate, our democratic House is being instrumentalised for Netanyahu's extremist campaign against UNWRA. The Commission did a full review of all financial assistance to Palestine at the end of 2023. We have had the Colonna Report. Unwra is the most vetted agency in UN history. What more proof of innocence are we looking for? Netanyahu knows better than anyone else that UNWRA is providing vital aid to the Palestinians and it's exactly for this reason that he aims to obstruct, criminalise and dissolve the agency, all to reach the greater goal of making Gaza inhabitable and colonise it. Let us please stick to the facts, uphold European values and support the oppressed, not the oppressor.
