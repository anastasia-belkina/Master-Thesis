Madam President, finally, the European Parliament is holding a debate here in the plenary about the scandalous fact that European taxpayers' money is being channelled to Islamists via the EU budget. Yes, the debate is taking place against the will of the Socialists and the Greens. You don't want the facts in the open. And when we want to condemn EU sponsorship of the glorification of the veil, the infamous 'freedom is in the hijab' campaign, for example, you vote against a condemnation. Why is that? Madam President, after I informed the French, Czech and Swedish Governments about EU support for Islamists, the Commission promised to review the rules. Positive signals, but this year it has been revealed that both Jihadists in Türkiye and the Al Sharq Forum, with links to the Muslim Brotherhood, have received EU funds. The current Commission, I'm sorry to say, Commissioner, but you failed. It is imperative that the new Commission stops, once and for all, the flow of taxpayer money to these organisations that want to destroy our Western societies.
