Madam President, first of all, thank you for having this debate today, because it's always good to be alerted and informed if there are some issues which might raise your attention and where I think action is needed. And it's always good to get this information. But also, let me emphasise again the Commission's strong commitment, indeed, to protecting the Union budget and preventing EU funds from reaching entities associated with terrorism or activities contrary to European Union values. We have, in principle, I have to say, a very robust legal framework in place and rigorous selection and monitoring processes, but nevertheless we rely also on information from different sources. And then, of course, we have to check what is the substance, and in case there is a misconduct, we have to react, and we react. I think the recent addition to the Financial Regulation of an explicit exclusion from funding in case of incitement to hatred or violence makes this framework even stronger. And in that context, I really would like to stress once again that the Union does not fund Hamas or any other terror groups, directly or indirectly. Hamas is a listed terrorist entity. We have very strict screening and vetting of beneficiaries. Our recent review has shown that the Commission controls and safeguards work well. All contracts with EU funds must respect EU law, including accountability and transparency. I would like to close by emphasising the Commission's continued work with the Parliament that the Union budget and EU values are well protected.
