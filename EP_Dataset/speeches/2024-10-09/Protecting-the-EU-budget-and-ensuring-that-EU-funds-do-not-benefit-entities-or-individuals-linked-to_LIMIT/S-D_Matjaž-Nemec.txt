Madam President, dear colleagues, let us be very clear: the EU has strict rules in place which control and oversee the financing of the budget. Those rules were even reinforced last year with clear provisions and excluding any financing of terrorism. Today's debate that was put forward has nothing to do with terrorism, but is simply placed in the hands of the Netanyahu Government's agenda and their systematic attacks on UNRWA   the organisation which is a lifeline for millions of Palestinian refugees   with only one goal: that is the dehumanisation of Palestinian people and ethnic cleansing. The proposal for this debate is deeply rooted in racism, and it's based on levels of racism and extremism which we have not seen since World War Two. The attack on UNRWA and the United Nations is an attack on humanity and an attack on common values, international law and institutions. I strongly reject those attempts and this narrative. Let us remain human and on the right side of the history. Good luck.
