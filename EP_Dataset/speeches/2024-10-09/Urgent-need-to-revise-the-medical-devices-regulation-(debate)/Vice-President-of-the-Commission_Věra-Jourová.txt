Madam President, honourable Members, I understand the calls for an urgent revision of the Medical Devices Regulations. However, after having worked together on extending the transitional periods, I would strongly caution against a rushed initiative. We must get this right on the basis of data and analysis, together with the necessary involvement of all the relevant stakeholders. The two Regulations on Medical Devices and In Vitro Diagnostics adopted are significant and complex pieces of legislation. The targeted evaluation process has already started, and it is important to gather the inputs and viewpoints needed for a thorough assessment. In line with the political indications of President von der Leyen, the Commissioner-designate for Health will prioritise the evaluation and any necessary followâ€‘up actions. The Commission will continue to work closely with the Parliament to promote innovation and competitiveness in the device sector, while safeguarding patients' safety.
