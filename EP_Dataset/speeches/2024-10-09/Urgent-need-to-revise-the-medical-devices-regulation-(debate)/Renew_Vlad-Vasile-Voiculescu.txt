Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, the European Union's medical device landscape is undergoing a major transformation. The old rules simply weren't equipped to handle the incredible advances that we've seen over the last couple of years. Let's think sophisticated software, nanotechnologies, 3D printing: game changers that demand a modern regulatory framework. On the other hand, if we're honest, past incidents have raised serious safety concerns. We need stricter regulations to ensure patient safety is paramount. That's where the Medical Devices Regulation should come in. At present, we're facing a bottleneck in notified bodies, increased complexity and costs for manufacturers, and delays in implementing the Eudamed database. Revising the Medical Devices Regulation will boost industry competitiveness, investment and research. As a liberal, all of these are close to my heart because I think medical industry advancement is the key to providing quality medical services to our patients. At the same time, medicine is not just an industry and a business. I will support regulation that favours the medical industry as long as I can see a clear guarantee that all advancements are in our patients' best interest.
