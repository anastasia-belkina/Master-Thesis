Mr President, dear Vera, colleagues, as a former Commissioner, in the time of my mandate, I was fully involved in the creation of new laws: the Medical Device Regulation and the In-Vitro Medical Device Regulation. These regulations aim to create a robust, transparent and sustainable regulatory framework that is recognised internationally and that improves clinical safety for patients and creates fair market access for manufacturers and healthcare professionals. These regulations seek to increase the transparency of the system through the collation of key supply chains to create a central register of supply chain operators and notifying bodies, to allow the Commission to investigate when a notifying body does not seem to be fulfilling its function properly and to allow international authorities to control a notifying body's assessment of a manufacturers' documentation before it is placed on the market. Vitally, under the new directives, notifying bodies and supply chain operators remain almost entirely responsible for pre-market control. I believe the Commission has sufficient tools and instruments to implement the allocated tasks. Now it has to press the European Union's Member States, producers and the notifying bodies to implement the requirements of these regulations. I think the transitional period of 2027 is long enough. And we need to not make additional delays in this process. Please remember: patient safety first. It is our duty really to realise this.
