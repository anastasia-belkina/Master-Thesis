Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for this rich debate. It is now clear that many countries around the world and many of our Member States have taken or are taking action to tax the super rich. But let us be very clear, capital can easily move across borders. Therefore, there should be no doubt that intervention at supranational level and at multilateral fora is what we need.Â The G20 can act as a catalyst and ensure a consistent framework for fair and effective taxation. Within the OECD global tax deal we have made significant progress towards fair taxation. Now, while we keep working for its full and consistent implementation, we will also engage with our global partners to build on this further, and notably to address this twin objective: address tax avoidance and address the rising inequalities, which, let's face it, are not acceptable in the world that we want. All taxpayers, and especially the ultra-high net worth individuals, should and need to pay their fair share of taxes.
