Mr President, honourable colleagues, security and defence are the keywords for this political term. But we tend to forget about growing social division, in-work poverty or marginalisation and social exclusion, not least the security risks and possible military action. I have to say, in the long term, maybe even bigger, because it can lead to unpredictable political turbulence, which will endanger the Union we are committed to defend. That is why we express our full support for the G20 presidency's proposal to introduce a tax on the wealthiest individuals as a means to address poverty and reduce inequality. The G20 report highlights that trillions of dollars are held offshore escaping taxation. These funds, if properly taxed, could be directed towards essential investments in education, healthcare and services to lift people out of poverty. While proper taxation of larger sums is important, it is part of a broader approach, which includes windfall taxation on excessive profits, such as those recommended by the Commission in 2022. And we must also advocate for a progressive income tax system across all Member States, ensuring that contributions are proportionate to one's ability to pay. The EU, as outlined in the Treaties, has a responsibility to promote social justice. Let's do it.
