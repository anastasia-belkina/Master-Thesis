MrÂ President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, taxing the super rich is a hot topic and you can see it was already mentioned also in the US presidential elections. Yet tax evasion is a major problem. The reality is that getting super rich often means paying super less in taxes. In a global market with varying conditions, capital can easily exploit differences to its advantage, seeking opportunities to multiply and avoid unnecessary charges. Studies and reality also show that stricter taxing rules have often failed to deliver the expected benefits to the state or to the public. Such was the case of the windfall tax applied in the Czech Republic. Therefore, as legislators, we should and must address the roots of this issue, which means the presence of a different level playing field in different countries which are part of the global market. Taxation is only the end of the story, but altogether all those issues have a direct impact on EU competitiveness. Therefore, solving this issue is key to promoting peace and equality, and to supporting global economic stability.
