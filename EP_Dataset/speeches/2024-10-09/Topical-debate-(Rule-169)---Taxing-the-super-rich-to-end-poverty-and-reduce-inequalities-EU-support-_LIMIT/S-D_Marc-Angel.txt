Mr President, Vice‑President of the Commission, colleagues, in Europe and all across the world we are confronted with a glaring injustice: the super rich are amassing grotesque amounts of wealth due to paying little or no taxes, and to due to avoiding measures and the tricks they use. They also disproportionately contribute to climate change. At the same time, ordinary people, small businesses, are diligently paying their taxes and are increasingly facing difficulties to make ends meet and are receiving insufficient support to master the many challenges they face. We can no longer accept this status quo. At a time when poverty is on the rise, when tackling climate change is super-urgent and rampant inequality is corroding our societies, we need to ensure that the super rich pay their fair share. As Socialists and Democrats, we welcome the G20 presidency proposal to elaborate a tax on the super rich, and polls show that the public are equally supportive. We now have to move towards a fairer society, with more revenues for governments to fight poverty and climate change and to invest in public services. The EU and all its Member States should lead by example in combating tax avoidance and ensuring adequate taxation of the super rich, and should play a leading role in this process in the appropriate fora.
