MrÂ President, as was said by the Commissioner at the beginning, the data are quite clear that, with the substantial contribution of the existing tax regime across the world, the super rich are just getting richer. It seems to me that it's really not good for society, there is no doubt about it. But I firmly believe it's also not good for the economy, at least in this extent. But at the same time, there are no doubts that finding a balanced functional response is far from easy, and only a more or less global response can work, as big money faces no borders. They are equipped by the best lawyers and best accountants that are finding the way how to make big money even bigger. So it will be a difficult journey. It will not be a short journey, but there is no excuse for not starting it. I guess the arguments are very clear. We need to reach the more or less global agreement that will tackle this issue, and we must start now. I guess that it was pointed out at the beginning, but to repeat once more, the OECD process fully backed by the G20 and G8 is the right way forward, but it must be also backed by strong and clear support of the EU. I guess this is what we should do.
