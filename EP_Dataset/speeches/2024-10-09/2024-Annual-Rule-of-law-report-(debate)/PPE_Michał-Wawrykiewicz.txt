Mr President, Vice-President Jourová, the rule of law has been a cornerstone of the European Union since the very beginning. Our Community was formed by those who showed exceptional respect for the rule of law. There is no democracy without it, no human rights without it, no border security, no free media, no freedom of economic activity, no equality and all the policies that the Union has implemented. This is simply the pillar of our Community. For many decades, this was not questioned   until the times of those who demonstrated contempt for the rule of law. Today, in this House was the one who first decided to openly disregard these principles. I'm, of course, talking about Viktor Orbán. After him, Kaczyński appeared. In my country, Poland, he decided to copy Orbán's model of autocracy. After eight years of hard battle for the independence of the judiciary and other devastated foundations of democracy, a huge commitment of civil society, the Polish legal community, especially judges full of courage and strength, as well as the very consistent attitude of the democratic opposition   we all managed to overcome this evil and proceed to restore democracy. This is a successful story. A huge role in this struggle was played by the European Union. Without our membership, it wouldn't happen. Thank you very much, Madam President, for your commitment. This report reminds us that neither today, nor in the future, we cannot forget, even for one moment, that the rule of law must be defended by all means. This is our shield of democracy.
