Mr President, thanks Madam Commissioner for the work of you and your colleagues on the rule of law. You have spoken about all the progress that has been made and that's all good. Unfortunately, we see that in a number of Member States there's also regress. Two things that I would like to point out: one is I think we clearly need to link the recommendations in the Rule of law report to actual consequences. And I also think that those countries, like in Slovakia, where the anti-corruption prosecution has been severely attacked now, we should not wait until all the damage is done and we can no longer repair anything. But there is a number of tools, like the conditionality mechanism, that is actually pre-emptive   so let's use it before it is too late. As we see in the second case in Hungary, where now for two years we have money frozen, we see not a single reform. And I would really like to know, when are you going to reinforce those sanctions so that we finally see an effect, because nothing is happening, and we've seen the colleague has mentioned the lies here this morning.
