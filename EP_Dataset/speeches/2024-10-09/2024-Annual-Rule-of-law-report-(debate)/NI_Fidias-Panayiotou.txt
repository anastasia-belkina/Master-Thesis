Mr President, my country Cyprus is mentioned in your 2024 Annual Rule of law report. From your assessment, Cyprus's justice system is lacking behind the European Union standard and I agree. In your assessment, you specifically refer to the case of the Auditor-General who was eventually fired by the Supreme Constitutional Court. I am here to express the anger of most Cypriots at this particular situation. A large majority of Cypriots believed that his firing was due to his effort to expose corruption, because those involved in corruption influenced the decision of firing. The fight against corruption always comes with a great vulnerability. Therefore, I call on the Commission to closely monitor the situation in Cyprus and help my country to overcome these vulnerabilities.
