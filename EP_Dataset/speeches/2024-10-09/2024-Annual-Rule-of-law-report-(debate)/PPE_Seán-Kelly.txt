A Uachtaráin,the 2024 report highlighted a number of shortcomings that we should be addressing: judicial independence, media freedom and anti‑corruption are just some of the areas where we see significant breaches of the rule of law. In Ireland, we have implemented a number of measures to improve our national judicial systems. However, we are only one Member State, and this is only one aspect of the rule of law. To affect change across the Union, we need to address the repeat offenders who make little or no effort to reduce their own violations. This will be the challenge faced by Irish Commissioner‑designate Michael McGrath as he starts on his portfolio. Over the past several years, we have seen Hungary breach multiple aspects of our core values again and again. Corruption is rampant, transparency is seriously lacking, independent governance is in serious danger. Prime Minister Orbán's most recent law on the defence of sovereignty exemplifies this. It is against the concept of democracy and the practice of fundamental rights, and it constitutes a breach of the rule of law. Now Hungary has the influential role of the Council Presidency. Orbán spoke earlier today about improving the EU and making it great again. This populist rhetoric is nothing short of hypocritical. We need to stand against these breaches and against Hungary's lip service.
