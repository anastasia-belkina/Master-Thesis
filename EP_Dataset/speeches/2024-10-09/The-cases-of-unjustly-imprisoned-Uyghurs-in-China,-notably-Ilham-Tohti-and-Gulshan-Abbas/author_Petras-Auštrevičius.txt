Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues, today we pay tribute to Sakharov Prize laureate Ilham Tohti, a Uyghur human rights defender, who has been in Chinese prison for ten years with a life sentence, and Gulshan Abbas, who was sentenced for 20 years for her sister's criticism of the Chinese regime's oppression of the Uyghurs. This is a very grim reality of communist China, where Beijing is in a quest for global hegemony and uses the harshest methods against human rights defenders, dissidents, and ethnic minorities. Beijing's systematic actions to destroy the historical and cultural identity of the Uyghurs, the uprooting of Tibetans from their historical lands and indoctrination of Tibetan children and the destruction of the democratic institutions in Hong Kong demand a very strong response from the European Union and the West in general. I call on the EU Member States and the European Union to take action in response to those deplorable crimes.
