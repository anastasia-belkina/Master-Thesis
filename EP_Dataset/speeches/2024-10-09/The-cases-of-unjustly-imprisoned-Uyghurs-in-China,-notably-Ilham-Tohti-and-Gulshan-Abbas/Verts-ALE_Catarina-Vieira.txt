Madam President, Commissioner, while the whole world is holding its breath about the horrible developments in Ukraine, Gaza and Lebanon, we cannot forget about the ever-continuing genocide of the Uyghurs. Hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs face systematic surveillance, persecution, mass imprisonment, torture and forced sterilisation. Brave activists like Ilham Tohti and Gulshan Abbas are being harassed, detained and silenced. The list of detained activists is getting longer by the day. Yet, exports from Xinjiang into the EU have risen by 140 % this year. From the cotton in our clothes to the electronic components in our gadgets, we are sponsoring the continuation of state-imposed forced labour. This is simply unacceptable. We must strictly enforce the forced labour ban. We must hold the Chinese regime accountable. We must prevent our complicity to this genocide.
