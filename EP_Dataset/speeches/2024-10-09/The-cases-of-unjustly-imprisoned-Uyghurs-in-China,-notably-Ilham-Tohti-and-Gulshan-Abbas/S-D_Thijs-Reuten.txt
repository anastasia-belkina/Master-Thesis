Madam President, Commission colleagues, in China's prison camps, about 1Â million Uyghurs are currently detained, many without trial, among them Ilham Tohti, the 2019 Sakharov Prize laureate, imprisoned for his peaceful advocacy for Uyghur rights. The Chinese regime deems his freedom of speech   simply asking for basic rights   to be separatism, resulting in a life sentence. Uyghur families often face sudden disappearance of loved ones, with detainees forced to abandon their identities in a process that the Chinese authorities call 're-education'. Even Uyghurs in the EU face repression of Beijing's long arm, extreme intimidation, threats to family members there when you speak out here. This transnational repression within the case of China, even police stations throughout Europe, must end. It's our duty to protect our citizens. Stop the arbitrary detention of Uyghurs and the human rights violations by the Chinese authorities and protect our citizens here.
