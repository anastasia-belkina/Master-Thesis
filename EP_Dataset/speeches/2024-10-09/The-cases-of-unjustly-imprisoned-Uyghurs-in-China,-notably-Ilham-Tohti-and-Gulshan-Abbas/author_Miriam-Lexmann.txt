Madam President, dear colleagues, Commissioner, during these days, the People's Republic of China is commemorating 75 years since its establishment. But despite all the regime propaganda, its track record is clear: 75 years of terror, oppression and suffering similar as we observed in the Soviet Union. Dear colleagues, this House as a first EU institution recognised our naivety towards this regime, and has been fundamental in shifting the European Union's attitude towards the totalitarian regime. This is why I sincerely welcome tonight's debate and resolution, and I want to thank colleagues all across the parties for their cooperation. The totalitarian regime is committing crimes against humanity against Uyghurs, Tibetans and other ethnic groups, and sowing its terror and oppression across mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. This is why we must continue to call for the release of Ilham Tohti, Gulshan Abbas and all those countless names imprisoned by the regime, and hold the regime accountable for it. As the regime continues to commit these crimes at home, it is no surprise that it is also behaving increasingly aggressively towards its neighbours, against Taiwan, and acting against our own democracies and freedom. History teaches us that these regimes always turn their domestic terror into later aiming towards external aggression. This is why speaking out for Ilham Tohti, Gulshan Abbas and the countless others is not only morally right, but it is also fundamental to defending our own freedom, peace and security. In this context, let me also come back to one matter we are currently observing in Parliament, namely when PRC officials are trying to access our meeting rooms and our meetings. This is absolutely not allowed and absolutely not possible   especially when Members of this House are still sanctioned, we can no longer allow PRC representatives to interfere with and humiliate our Members.Â On the contrary, we must stand united in defence of human rights.
