MadamÂ President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, since the beginning of this mandate, one thing has become crystal clear to me. A majority of this House wants an operational, well-funded Frontex which can enforce the law while respecting fundamental rights. It is therefore difficult to explain to our citizens back home that the Member States   the same governments who talk with big words and tear down the Schengen Area and steal our freedom of movement   those are the ones who are actively pushing for less money for Frontex, cutting its requested budget and making it impossible to perform adequately in the light of tremendous challenges. There are, of course, governments and groups in this Parliament who are not really interested in controlling migration and crime at our external border, because it takes away the oxygen from their populist message. But I also believe that many other governments, just like this Chamber, do see that this is the moment to put our money where our mouth is. And I trust your sense of responsibility. Let's work together.
