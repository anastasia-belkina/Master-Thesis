I think there are two things we have to do. First, you have to make sure that asylum seekers always can enter here if they are in need of protection. So you need to have procedures for them to come. If we're going to make our borders tougher, people will find other routes; people that are in need. And it's going to only be more dangerous. We're going to push people in the hands of smugglers. On the other hand, we can work on more labour migration. All the visa procedures, everything we do on labour migration is so divided. So if we first harmonise that, then we can actually see how we can attract talent and make sure that people integrate well.
