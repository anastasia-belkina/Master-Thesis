Mr President, colleagues, the need for a comprehensive approach to secure Europe's external borders is what we are here to debate. And yet the approach cannot be comprehensive nor effective without physical border barriers. But the EU won't fund that. Frontier Member States should not face the Russian threat alone, nor the Belarussian, Moroccan, Turkish... Helping them with IT and surveillance systems is good, but not enough to delay and prevent migrants from entering illegally. If the Commission keeps refusing to change its mind, the Council and Parliament will have to force them to fund border barriers through, for example, the Integrated Border Management Fund. The comprehensive approach needed to secure Europe's borders should, has to, include funding of physical border barriers. Time to get the job done!
