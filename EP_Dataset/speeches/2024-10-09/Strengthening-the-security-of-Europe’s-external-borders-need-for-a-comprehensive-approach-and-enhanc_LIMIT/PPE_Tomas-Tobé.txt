Mr President, Vice‑President Schinas, colleagues, let me start by reminding you that we had a debate in this plenary on Monday evening about internal border controls and the state of Schengen. Now we're about to discuss the external borders. For me, it is clear that these issues are connected. Yes, the European Union is about free movement. For this to be possible, we must regain control of our external border with an expansion of Frontex, more cooperation with third countries, full implementation of the Migration Pact and EU funding for border infrastructure. I would like to use my time actually to address some of the colleagues in this House. Let me start with the colleagues on the left. I very often hear you talk about the right to asylum, but at the same time you are delaying efforts to differentiate people with grounds for asylum from those who have not. I hear you talking about abolishing internal border controls, but at the same time, whenever the EPP suggests that we need to take back control of our external borders, you are against this. To some of the colleagues on the populist far right side, you very often talk about how we need to stop illegal migration, but you also say no to EU cooperation on migration. Your aversion to the European Union trumps your desire to control migration with common measures. For the EPP, it is clear that the European Union must take control of our external border jointly. We need a bigger and stronger Frontex, and this cannot be guided by either 'abolish borders' fantasies or the fact that we cannot work together. We need to work together to have a strong Europe and a safe Europe.
