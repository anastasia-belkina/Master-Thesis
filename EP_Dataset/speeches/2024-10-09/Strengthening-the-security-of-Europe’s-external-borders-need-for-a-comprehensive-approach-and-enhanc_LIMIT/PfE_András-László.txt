Mr President, we've heard these speeches very often, also from Ms von der Leyen, 'we want more legal pathways'. But the situation is that there have already been millions of people who entered the EU illegally and they have not been able to integrate. So Ms von der Leyen wants millions to enter legally. How many more would you like in your country?
