MrÂ President, this is a very important debate. The Irish Government would absolutely love to blame the European Union for its massive failure to build houses. But the reality is that it's all on them. One of its failures is to get enough workers trained. But the reality is you'll never get enough workers trained in an industry that doesn't provide you with certainty. My father was a builder in Ireland, a carpenter. In the 1960s, he had to emigrate to get work. In the 1970s, there was work in Ireland so he could come back. In the 1980s, he had a family, including myself and my five siblings. He couldn't emigrate. There was no work. All of us had to emigrate. In the late 1990s we had another boom. Then we had another bust in the 2000s, and then everyone had to emigrate again. I met with Christophe Hansen, the potential future Agriculture Commissioner, during the week, and my assistant was with me. And the question was asked, 'would you ask your children to get into agriculture?' And the answer was no, because you can't have a guaranteed future. Likewise, I would not advise my children to go into the building industry until we get a plan   a long term plan that doesn't treat these workers like dirt and provides them with a definite future. You wouldn't do it if you didn't have a future.
