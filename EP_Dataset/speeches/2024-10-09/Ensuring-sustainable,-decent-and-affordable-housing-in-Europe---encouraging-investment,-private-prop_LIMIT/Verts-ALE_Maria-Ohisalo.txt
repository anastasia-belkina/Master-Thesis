Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, nearly 1.3 million people sleep rough or without permanent accommodation in the EU. 400,000 children are homeless. And I welcome the long awaited affordable-housing plan by the Commission, which must build on the successful Housing First principle. This requires actually a change in our mindsets, because, previously, a home was an outcome when a person demonstrated progress in their lives, such as finding a job or tackling substance abuse. The thinking was that only by solving other issues first, a person deserves a home. But the reality is exactly the opposite. Housing is a human right. Only from the safety of one's home can a person start solving other challenges in their lives. When we discuss about what affordable housing means, who builds and who owns it, and how it is regulated, we must keep in our minds the most vulnerable people whose lives can actually be transformed if we, politicians here and all over Europe, just put housing first.
