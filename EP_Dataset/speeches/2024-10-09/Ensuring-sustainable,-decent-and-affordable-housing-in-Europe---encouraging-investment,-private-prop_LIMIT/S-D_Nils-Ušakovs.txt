Mr President, dear colleagues, in Latvia, especially in the border region of Latgale, there are hundreds of apartment buildings that have had no central heating for the last three decades. This was cut off during the energy crisis of the 1990s after Latvia regained its independence. As a result, each room has a separate coal‑burning stove, with numerous pipes sticking out of every single apartment. Obviously, that's a disaster from the environmental point of view and from the energy efficiency point of view. Altogether, we are talking about thousands of buildings that need renovation, and Latvia needs roughly EUR 20 billion to deal with this challenge. What we have at the moment at our disposal, including money from Brussels, is roughly EUR 200 million   that is 1 %, approximately. Providing sufficient support for building new affordable housing, and at the same time providing sufficient support for renovating existing housing, especially in the eastern part of the European Union, should be two pillars of the European Housing Programme.
