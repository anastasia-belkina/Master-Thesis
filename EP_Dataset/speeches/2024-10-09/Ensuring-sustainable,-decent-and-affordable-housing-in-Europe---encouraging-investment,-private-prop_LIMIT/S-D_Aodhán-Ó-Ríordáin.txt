Mr President, housing is the social justice issue of our generation, and in my city of Dublin rents have reached record levels, with the average rent now hitting EUR 2 300 per month, and most young Dubliners have given up on the hope of ever owning a home. As Social Democrats, we have put the housing crisis at the core of our agenda for the next five years. We have delivered the EU's first-ever Commissioner for housing, and I am happy that it will be in the hands of a colleague, Social Democrat Dan Jørgensen. We must deliver an EU affordable housing plan. However, there is one glaring omission from the EU Commission mission letter. The issue of homelessness. The EU has set aside the goal of eliminating homelessness by 2030. We have five years to go and we are moving in the wrong direction. 4 400 Irish children are homeless. That is 4 400 stolen childhoods. We can and we must house our people. And as has been said, a roof is a right.
