MrÂ President, dear colleagues, firstly, I would like to suggest looking to housing from the perspective of demographic winter. As highlighted by researchers, the housing market is an example of social structural factors that can inadvertently impact age at first birth. In countries where it is easier to obtain a mortgage or enter the public rental market, individuals are more able to establish themselves and enter into family formation earlier. Research also showed the impact of affordable housing on child development. They found that when families spent more than half of their incomes on housing, their children's reading and math ability tended to suffer. Secondly, if we really want to take a critical step towards making houses more affordable and creating the conditions to promote families, we have to rethink very strict regulations on energy neutrality of houses and environmental transition. That definitely makes houses less affordable.
