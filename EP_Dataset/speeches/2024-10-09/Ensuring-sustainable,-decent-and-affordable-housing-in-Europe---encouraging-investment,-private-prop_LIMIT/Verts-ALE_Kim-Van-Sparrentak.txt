Mr President, in January 2021, as rapporteur of the European Parliament's report on access to decent and affordable housing, I called on the EU to address the housing crisis, to treat the right to housing as the human right that it is. And I'm happy to see that we have made some progress. We are now working towards ending homelessness, and we made sure cities can combat illegal rentals on Airbnb. But unfortunately, the housing crisis has only worsened since then. House prices and rents, as well as homelessness, just keep rising all over Europe. With a commissioner for housing and a European affordable action plan for housing in the works, we are finally treating the issue with the urgency it deserves   because homes are for people, not for profit. And let me be clear: the issue isn't just a lack of investment in housing. It is the wrong type of investment. EUR 40 billion were actually invested by institutional investors in Berlin in a decade and the result is that one of the most affordable cities became unaffordable. We must act as the EU to really kerb speculative investment. We need more social investment. The Commission's plans, which include boosting affordable housing, are promising, but we need to acknowledge that we need more public investment in social housing and that funding or loans from the European Investment Bank should not go to the institutional investors that are now driving the crisis. We must ensure that the investment contributes to long-term affordability through strict conditions. I look forward to future debates on housing, working with the Commission and colleagues to fulfil our promise of making housing the human right for all that it is.
