MrÂ President, Members, I want to first welcome the appointment of the new commissioner position for housing alongside the energy portfolio, which I believe has been long overdue. Housing, as we all know, remains one of the most critical challenges facing governments across Europe. Given its importance, I believe a dedicated committee should be established by Parliament to address this issue in a focused and comprehensive manner. I would ask that a Europe-wide plan be formulated by this committee, which would then be presented to the Commission and the Council for evaluation. And while I cannot speak for the situation in every Member State, I do know that in Ireland we have been confronting a housing crisis for several years now. Have we solved it? Most definitely not. But we must acknowledge that significant progress has been made. We have increased housing output, improved access for first time buyers, removed unnecessary regulatory barriers and fast-tracked some   but not all   planning delays and mobilised state lands for affordable and social housing. These are important steps forward. However, to sustain and build on this momentum, it is essential that we review State aid rules as determined by the EU to ensure that they do not hinder Member States in addressing housing emergencies when they arise. Our shared goal of delivering decent, affordable housing for all citizens requires continued flexibility and support at almost every level, including this one.
