Mr President, I want to really welcome this debate today because housing supply is a real challenge in many Member States, as we can see from the contributions today. But we all know that home ownership is really good for society and, as legislators, I think we have to make sure that we do everything we can to make it a reality for all of our citizens. And whilst Member States' governments are at the front line of actually delivering and tackling the crisis, there's a lot of things that we can do here at an EU level. First of all, I think we can learn from each other what works and what doesn't work and don't repeat it. We can ensure that there are EU funds available and that the rules around planning and procurement are not overly onerous as they are in my own country. And we can coordinate resources to ensure that governments do have access to the skilled workforce. Because in Ireland, money is not our problem. It's the lack of people to actually build the houses that has been an issue for us over the last number of years. But because the challenge is different in different places, we do need to recognise and monitor the problems. In Ireland though we're making important progress. More than 115 000 homes have been delivered since 2020, and it's rising. In the last 12 months alone, 51 000 new bills have been commenced and the number of first time buyers is at its highest levels in years, thanks to the government interventions such as the Help to Buy scheme. But there's an awful lot more we can do, and this social challenge should rightly be at the top of our new housing DG's agenda, which will be Commissioner Jørgensen's Commission task, and I want to wish him well and support him.
