MrÂ President, colleagues, are you kidding? Those of you who support this ridiculous directive, this ridiculous concept of helping where you brought damage, mending what you spoilt. Is this the same place where that famous Energy Efficiency Directive was so highly acclaimed? Is this the same European Commission that introduced that bill? Let's introduce your euro-communism in the Sahara Desert and very soon we will be short of sand. I've been there, I've seen that. I come from the country where socialism was forcibly introduced from Moscow and now you're trying to to repeat the same from Brussels.
