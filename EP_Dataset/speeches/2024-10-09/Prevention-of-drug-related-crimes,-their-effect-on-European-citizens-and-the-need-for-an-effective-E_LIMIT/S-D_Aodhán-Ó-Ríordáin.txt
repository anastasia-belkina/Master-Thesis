Madam President, the debate about drugs is not really about drugs at all. It's actually about power: those who have it and those who don't. The war on drugs is a complete and utter waste of time, and it's hurting vulnerable citizens. It is a total misunderstanding of the nature of addiction   'If we just ban drugs and arrest the people who take them, everything will be fine'. Well, it doesn't work. People in every walk of life, in every income bracket   including in politics, journalism, the judiciary and the police   take drugs, but they're not the ones who end up in court. The people who end up in court are those who society feels are powerless. I agree we need to take drug supply away from the hands of drug gangs who terrorise our communities. But we need to spend the money wasted on criminalising the drug user on harm reduction, support and education. Europe doesn't need a war on drugs. Europe needs a war on poverty, on social exclusion and on homelessness. We must decriminalise the drug user across Europe.
