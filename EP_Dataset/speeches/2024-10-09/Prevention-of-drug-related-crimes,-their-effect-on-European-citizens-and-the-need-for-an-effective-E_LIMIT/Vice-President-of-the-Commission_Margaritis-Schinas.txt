Madam President, honourable Members, thank you all for this very rich debate. I believe that there is one thing that we can all agree here today â€‘ the situation is dire. Drug-related organised crime is growing both in power and violence. And we have a duty as European policy makers gets to stop it. Thanks to our work, to our collective work, the EU is better equipped than five years ago in this fight. However, as many of you have underlined, this is a battle which is ongoing. As criminals evolve, we need to be one step ahead of them. We need to continue working on prevention with the people at the centre of our action, and we need to have in mind that this is a cross-border trade. These criminal networks operate across control systems, across frontiers, and they have a fantastic ability to exploit legal and technological gaps. They know how to infiltrate our business and our society, and this will remain a continuing challenge for collective responses. And this response, the European response, as we all agree, would need to involve not only regulation, not only laws, not only strategies, but also operational cooperation on the ground, including international cooperation with law enforcement agencies, but also with first-line social workers, people who know the problem from the field. This response should also clearly target the root causes and the economic incentives that make these criminal networks thrive. If we manage to work in all these workstreams, then we would be able to protect our people, reinforce our institutions, and defend our societies from this significant threat. And I know that this House will continue to provide support to these policy objectives.
