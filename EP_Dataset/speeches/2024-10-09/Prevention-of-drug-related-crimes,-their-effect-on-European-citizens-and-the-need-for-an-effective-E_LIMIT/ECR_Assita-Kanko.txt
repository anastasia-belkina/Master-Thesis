MadamÂ President, Vice-President Schinas, drug-related crime is eating away our society. Laundering money. Funding terrorism. Destroying our neighbourhoods. Bringing drugs into our schools. Disrupting our maritime transport. Creating healthcare issues. Threatening businesses and killing innocent people. Exhausting police resources. Killing journalists and lawyers. Trying to muzzle the politicians who dare to fight them. Remember Dutch journalist Peter R. de Vries, shot three years ago in the streets of Amsterdam. Regularly there are drug-related liquidations in Brussels. Last year, an 11-year-old girl was killed in a drug shooting in Antwerp. Antwerp mayor Bart de Wever, who dares fight the drugs criminals, was threatened and put under police protection. Not only Antwerp, but also Rotterdam and Hamburg face serious challenges that cities alone cannot solve, because drug-related crime and violence is not a local issue; it is a global issue with serious local impact. The drugs in our ports come mainly from South America. The EU must unite efforts for better container scanning and common safety procedures. We need international cooperation and coordinated diplomatic pressure on state complicity and corruption. If the criminals have faster mobility and technology, it's because we did not innovate enough, because we did not sufficiently fund and enhance police and judicial cooperation. If they have liquidity, it is because we did not tackle money laundering enough. As a society, we also need a change in mindset. Drugs and terrorism work hand in hand. Drugs have nothing glamorous. Crime is its only face. There is no such thing as soft drugs. There is only blood drugs. If we don't stop it, we will not be safe.
