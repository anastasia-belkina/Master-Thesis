Madam President, the case of Bülent Mumay ofDeutsche Welleexemplifies the systemic repression of independent journalism. As noted in this joint motion, his case is baseless and serving only one purpose: to intimidate him and other journalists who dare to investigate. After transformations in Turkish civil society and media of the recent years, voices of constructive criticism like Mumay's are rare and really require immense courage, and we need to recognise them. But this Parliament must also condemn actions like legal intimidation, censorship and financial pressure, which are used to silence the press. Because even in our own Member States our 'wannabe autocrats' are getting inspired by them. And as a former journalist, I take cases like Mumay's very personally. We need to make sure that press freedom and freedom of expression are protected in the EU, in Türkiye and beyond. (The speaker concluded in Turkish)
