Madam President, colleagues, the pressure on journalists, the opposition, civil society and critical voices in Türkiye is escalating. The charges against prominent journalist Bülent Mumay is another case how to silence critical journalism. This sentence is sends a clear signal to all those brave, independent journalists who report on matters of public interest, namely the AKP's corruption and clientelism. Mumay's case is not an isolated incident, but part of a broader pattern of judicial harassment and censorship targeting Türkiye's independent media. Dear friends in Türkiye, you are heard and not forgotten. People in Türkiye need international attention to protect their fundamental rights and freedoms. We cannot trade Turkish democracy, freedom and rule of law for some economic or migration interests. Europe needs to stand by its values within the Union as well as in its immediate neighbourhood. Freedom for all those who fight for democracy in Türkiye!
