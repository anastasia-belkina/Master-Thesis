Madam President, I understand that this is a discussion about the priorities of the Hungarian Presidency, despite the fact that many of the speakers are speaking about their feelings and about the different facts, so they should be taken away the floor. But my question for Mr Körner is: can you explain to me, please, how is it connected the national discussion or national decisions of Hungarian Prime Minister or the Hungarian Government with the Presidency of the European Union? Because I didn't understand very much from your presentation. How is this correlated or connected? You didn't very much speak about the Presidency priorities, which I would like to hear, finally, somebody in this room to speak about. Because this is just the hearing of Mr Prime Minister of Hungary and not the Presidency discussion which should be here.
