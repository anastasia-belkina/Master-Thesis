Madam President, Commissioner, our House of democracy just served as a platform for the propaganda of Prime Minister Orbán. Because the truth doesn't serve his interests. The truth is that he's a corrupt, disloyal, and ruthless violator of the EU's most fundamental values. Instead of listening to him, we should give the microphone to the Hungarian people who face the daily hardship of living under his autocracy. The teachers, the judges, human rights defenders, journalists and academics who fight for the values that the EU stands for and simply demand the same freedoms and protection as every EU citizen. Yet this man is punishing them with smear campaigns and intimidating investigations. However, a solid majority in this House defends our allies and genuinely joins forces, and we urge the Council and Commission to go all in with our response, just like Orbán does with his destruction. This presidency fails to meet its duty to hold a hearing under Article 7(1). We urge the Council to use Article 7(2) and prevent Orbán from hijacking EU decision-making and the Commission to keep EU funding frozen until the rule of law is restored for real. Be consistent, credible and act with urgency. If we cannot protect our EU citizens against autocrats, our EU democracy is bound to fail.
