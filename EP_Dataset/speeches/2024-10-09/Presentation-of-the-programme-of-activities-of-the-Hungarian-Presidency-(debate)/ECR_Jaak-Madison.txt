Madam President, first of all, Mr Orbán, as conservatives, of course we can agree on many points. We can agree that we need a strong migration policy. We need to turn around the crazy green ideology. We need to protect our heritage, our culture, our Christian values. Definitely. And I also agree that there are so many double standards and hypocrisy in the EU. We talk about the Russia policy, yet we are importing more gas than before the war. So we are financing the Russian war against Ukraine. That's true. But at the same time, it's not a very good excuse to do the same. I remember very well, a few weeks after the war started, there was a question, 'Will Hungary allow the use of at least its territory to move military aid to Ukraine?', Hungary said 'No'. Why? If we talk about diplomacy, every war will end finally with diplomacy. That's true. But the question is what consequences will there be after the war? Because today we see a huge risk for the whole of Europe. Also for Estonia, to my country. And what have you done, really, to stand up against Russia and to protect Ukraine, even if you have a difficult history with Ukraine. But this is the question for the future and our security. What have you done?
