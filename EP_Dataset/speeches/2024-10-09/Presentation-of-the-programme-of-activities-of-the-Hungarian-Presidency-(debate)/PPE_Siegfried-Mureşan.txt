Madam President, Prime Minister, dear colleagues, we are here to discuss the Hungarian Council Presidency, the relations between the European Union and Hungary, and about European values. The truth is, the Council Presidency is always an opportunity for a country to present its people, to present its traditions, to present its regions. Unfortunately, the current Hungarian Government is missing out on this opportunity. A Council Presidency is an opportunity also to deliver, and unfortunately this Council Presidency is not delivering. Thirteen years ago, the Hungarian Council presidency had results, had achievements   today, none. Let me say very clearly, this is the first Council Presidency of an EU Member State with zero achievements. Today, unfortunately, Hungary is weaker and more isolated than ever and this is the consequences of your decisions, Prime Minister   you're limiting and controlling media in Hungary, you're attacking opposition, you're attacking civil society, you're attacking the judiciary, you're attacking the free world and you are defending dictators instead of working for the people of Hungary. This Hungarian Government works for Vladimir Putin, and this is something that concerns us all. Hungary is losing opportunities. While inflation was 6 % in Europe, it was 18 % in Hungary, when it was 10 % in Europe, it was 28 % in Hungary. Deficit is 3 % in Europe, it is 6 % in Hungary. We have European funds available for the people of Hungary and we are sorry to see the people of Hungary missing out on this opportunity due to the actions of this government. The current Hungarian Government is an obstacle to the desire of the European Union to help the people of Hungary. This is why we have to conclude that this government is unfortunately bad for Europe; it is bad for Hungary and bad for the people of Hungary.
