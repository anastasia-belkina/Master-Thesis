Madam President, Prime Minister, in just three months, your presidency has revealed your true vision for Europe. You began by hijacking the presidency for a grandstanding trip to Moscow, pretending to seek peace while playing into the hands of Russian propaganda. Here we are, 66 days later, and Mr Putin still continues to bombard and occupy Ukrainian territory. You then push through doubtful visa policies for Russian citizens   bypassing essential security measures   at a time when Europe faces an escalating threat of Russian sabotage and espionage. Now your close collaborators are even revising historical memory in Central Europe. A country that, like mine, saw Russian tanks rolling through the streets, now suggests that defending freedom is a mistake. This is profoundly disappointing given Hungary's history of resisting oppression. Today I heard no real vision on competitiveness or security. You always say you are a man of action, yet all you gave us is a list of meetings your presidency will organise. Is this your way to make Europe great again? The young, pro-Western and reform-minded politician you once were would be ashamed to see what you have become today.
