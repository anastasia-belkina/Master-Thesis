Madam President, dear colleagues, today the people of Ukraine are showing incredible bravery in the face of brutal aggression. Hungary, like Ukraine, Latvia and other nations, suffered under the oppressive occupation of the Soviet Union   an evil empire that once dominated its neighbours. The same evil has been reborn in Russia. Nations that remember this history are standing firmly with Ukraine. However, Hungary vetoes our crucial support for Ukraine and your alliance with Putin, Mr Orbán, is weakening Europe's response. Mr Orbán, you value your unequal friendship with war criminal Putin over supporting the Ukrainian people. Or perhaps you agree with your adviser's remarks calling resistance to Russia irresponsible? Ukraine's fight is about protecting the security and values of all of Europe. The EU must stand firm in its support of Ukraine and, Mr Orbán, you must decide which side of history you want to be on.
