Madam President, dear colleagues, dictator, the European Parliament is the beating heart of European democracy. And this Parliament is the arch enemy of autocrats like you. Mr Orbán, you're the most corrupt politician in the European Union. You and your cronies, you stole money on an insane scale. At least EUR 14 billion that went to your country during your premiership have been lost. Who has ever stolen over 10 000 money transporters' worth of EU funds? And the biggest trick you have played is that you distract people from your heist with hate against minorities, with propaganda about gender, with so-called peace initiatives. But this money was meant to fix roads, schools and to benefit the Hungarians. But instead you build a football stadium in your backyard, you build palaces, and you have made your childhood friend Mészáros the richest man in Hungary. Mr Orbán, we want our money back. And to all of us, we have to stop this steal. No more EU funds for Hungary. Let's take his veto away and let's stop inviting him here to this Parliament. Instead, there should be a European arrest warrant. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question)
