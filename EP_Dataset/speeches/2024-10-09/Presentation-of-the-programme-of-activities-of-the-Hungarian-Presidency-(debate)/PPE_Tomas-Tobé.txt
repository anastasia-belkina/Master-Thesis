MadamÂ President, Commissioner, Prime Minister, the presidency of the Council comes with both great opportunity and great responsibility. Prime Minister, you say that you want to discuss the political priorities of the Hungarian Presidency. For example, you say that you want to reinforce European defence, you want to regain control of the external border. I welcome these priorities. The problem is that you and your government act in the opposite way. Instead of focusing on strengthening the defence of Europe, you went to Moscow to shake hands with Putin, the man who wants nothing else than to destroy Europe. He is the man who has launched a war of aggression against your own neighbour, Ukraine. Instead of ensuring a strong external border and increasing the internal security of the Schengen Area, your government have decided to make it easier for potential Russian spies and saboteurs to access the Union. That is the truth of what is happening. We have no problem to discuss your priorities, but I would argue that the citizens of Hungary and Europe deserve better. Trust me: change is coming, also to Hungary with the Tisza Party. Get ready.
