Madam President, dear colleagues, forcing a girl into marriage at the age of nine. This is not tradition. This is not religion. This is a crime. Iraq has a proud history of women fighting for equal rights. The Personal Status Law of 1959 was once among the most progressive in the region. Iraq's constitution guarantees that a quarter of parliamentary seats are reserved for women, and women played, indeed, a leading role in the recent protests for social justice and against corruption. But apparently this progress has terrified some men so deeply that they are now trying to bypass those constitutional rights, dragging women back into submission. The proposed amendments to Iraq's Personal Status Law would allow religious leaders to override constitutional guarantees, imposing their own interpretation of sharia law on women, which means legalising child marriage and stripping women of their rights to divorce and inheritance. Civil society has been excluded from consultations, and behind the scenes shady deals are indeed being made along sectarian lines. So let me be very clear: this Parliament and this Union stand with those who assault women's rights in Iraq and everywhere else.
