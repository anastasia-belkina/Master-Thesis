Madam President, Commissioner, 'The time of the concubines is over. Women are no longer slaves.' These are the words chanted by the women of Iraq on the streets of every Iraqi city. In 2004, there was the first attempt to implement this law and it was stopped at that time. But now, 20 years later, this law has come back to haunt the girls and women in Iraq. This anti-women agenda is driven by the Shia Muslim political parties. We know that. But now it has also gotten the approval of the Sunni Muslim parties and the Kurdish parties because they have been promised their fair share of the cake of the legislation. And we know exactly what kind of legislation they are they're wanting. If this new law passes, nine-year-old girls could be legally married   and this in a country where domestic violence is not criminalised. This rolling-back of women's rights is shameful. And we from the European Parliament urge the Iraqi Parliament to start listening to the judicial experts, to civil society and stop this proposal of amending the civil law in Iraq.
