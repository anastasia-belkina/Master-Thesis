Madam President, colleagues, the proposed legislation in Iraq is a disgrace and yet another proposal to limit women's and girls' rights. Thirty thousand girls are married off every and each day globally. One out of five girls are already married.Â Girls are not brides: girls are children and should be playing with toys, not giving birth and satisfying a man. We live in a world where gender equality is on backlash: our bodies, our voices, our lives, our existence are still not in our hands today, regardless of if we talk about the Middle East, Europe, South America, North America, or Asia. Patriarchal norms, a medieval mentality, cemented gender roles, poverty and lack of respect of children's rights: the reasons are many, but the consequence is the same   a violation of our fundamental rights as women and girls. Iraq risks taking a step towards a gender apartheid, as in Afghanistan and Iran, with this new legislation. The Iraqi people are very clear: over 73% strongly oppose this evil proposal. The Iraqi government should listen to its people and consign this proposed legislation to the dustbin of history.
