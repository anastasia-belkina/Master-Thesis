A Uachtaráin, we are witnessing a deeply troubling development in Iraq with the proposed amendments to the personal status law. These changes would effectively place family matters   including marriage, divorce and child custody   under the jurisdiction of religious courts rather than civil law. This move undermines the principle of equality before the law, as enshrined in Iraq's own constitution, and would lead to disturbing discrepancies along religious lines. This is a significant step backwards for women's rights in Iraq. It threatens to increase child marriage, domestic violence and inequality, perpetuating a cycle of suffering for women and girls. Already, 22 % of unregistered marriages in Iraq involve girls under the age of 14, some as young as 9. This is appalling and we must condemn it in the strongest possible terms. The EU cannot turn a blind eye to this issue. Women's rights are human rights, whether it is in Iraq or Afghanistan.
