To implement a rule-based classifier based on the paper "Detecting Expressions of Blame or Praise in Text," which relies on the Path Model of Blame, here is a detailed step-by-step plan:

### 1. Understand the Path Model of Blame
The Path Model of Blame consists of stages that help determine whether a particular text expresses blame or praise. The key stages include:
- **Event Detection:** Identify whether a relevant event is present.
- **Agent Causality:** Determine if a moral agent is responsible for the event.
- **Foreseeability and Coercion:** Identify if the event was foreseeable by the agent or if coercion played a role.

### 2. Prepare the Environment
Ensure your environment is set up:
- Install necessary Python libraries: `nltk`, `spacy`, `scikit-learn`, `StanfordNLP`, etc.
- Load the necessary NLP models and tools like POS taggers, dependency parsers, and named entity recognition (NER) models.

### 3. Text Preprocessing
Start with typical text preprocessing steps:
- **Sentence Splitting and Tokenization:** Break the text into sentences and words.
- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:** Annotate each word with its POS tag.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identify entities like people, organizations, etc.
- **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD):** Resolve ambiguity for words with multiple meanings.

### 4. Event Detection
- **Verb-Object Pattern Identification:** Using dependency parsing, detect events by identifying verbs paired with their objects.
- **Polarity Detection:** Classify events as positive or negative based on sentiment analysis using lexicons (e.g., SentiWordNet).
- **Negation Handling:** Consider negations during sentiment analysis to correctly classify the event's polarity.

### 5. Agent Causality Determination
- **Identify Moral Agents:** Use NER to detect whether the subject is a person, organization, or country.
- **Causation Patterns:** Apply patterns like "NP verb NP" (noun-phrase, verb, noun-phrase) to identify causality.

### 6. Foreseeability and Coercion
- **Foreseeability:** Detect verbs that imply foreknowledge (e.g., communication verbs like "say", "tell").
- **Coercion:** Identify verbs or phrases indicating coercion (e.g., "forced", "pressured", "coerced").

### 7. Classification Logic
Based on the above features, classify the text as one of the following:
- **Blame:** The agent is held responsible for a negative event.
  - **Self-Blame:** The agent is the speaker themselves.
  - **Blame Others:** The agent is another person or entity.
- **Praise:** The agent is credited for a positive event.
  - **Self-Praise:** The agent is the speaker.
  - **Praise Others:** The agent is another person or entity.
- **Others:** No blame or praise is expressed.

### 8. Corpus Annotation and Data Preparation
- Use the ISEAR dataset or any similar corpus annotated for blame and praise.
- If you create a new dataset, follow annotation guidelines similar to the paper (label sentences as "blame", "praise", or "others").

### 9. Rule Implementation
Translate the above logic into Python code:
- Use conditionals and logical rules to classify text based on detected features.
- Implement checks for agent causality, foreseeability, and coercion.

### 10. Evaluation
- Compare your rule-based classifier against supervised models like SVM or Naive Bayes using standard metrics (precision, recall, F1-score).
- Perform 10-fold cross-validation to validate the performance.

### 11. Error Handling and Refinement
- Handle edge cases, such as sentences without clear verb-object pairs or ambiguous sentiment.
- Refine your rules based on evaluation results.

### 12. Fine-Grained Classification
- Extend your rules to distinguish between different types of blame and praise (self-blame, blame-others, etc.) based on agent pronouns and entity types.

### 13. Testing and Optimization
- Test on different types of text, including informal sources like social media.
- Optimize by incorporating additional linguistic features or expanding your verb and sentiment lexicons.

### 14. Documentation and Reporting
- Document your approach, including any assumptions or challenges encountered.
- Compare your results with those reported in the original paper, focusing on key insights.

By following this plan, you can replicate the blame/praise detection approach outlined in the paper while gaining a deeper understanding of rule-based NLP systems.
